# CrudExample (Pixel Designer)
A simple WebSite built with Bootstrap v4.1.3 that uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This page contains a table where you can create your own pixel design of `10x10` size. But it'll be a difficult job to make your design since every "pixel" has to be inserted individually simulating basic CRUD operations.
